    <P>I am an amazing artist and creator. I work as a freelance visual artist and 
      I am currently going back to school for Website Development. This will be the second path of college. I received my first Associates Degree in Drafting and Design.  
       I believe very strongly in self-teaching, and that it takes time and patience to be excellent at your craft.  Likewise, I have learned to adapt to changing environments both in my
      personally and professional life.  I have worked in different industries; all of which demands updating your skills.
      As you read through the pages, you will see my skills improve. As time goes by you will see it improve dramatically.
     </p>
      <p>  In working with different industries, one thing is certain; all of them demand consistently updating your skill
         and knowledge base.  I hope as you read through the pages you will not only see my process but also the gradual
          transformation into the working expert I wish to become. Below are high-lights I would bring to the table.</p>
  
      <p style ="text-align: center;">
        <ul>
          <li>Creativity toward problem-solving</li>
          <li>Team oriented collaborations</li>
          <li>Relatable work experience that is transferrable to any industry</li>
          <li>Works independently and utilizes resources</li>
          <li>Solutions oriented</li>
        </ul>
